# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Predictor-in-USA
This model is designed to estimate healthcare costs for individuals in the United States based on demographic and health-related factors. This tool leverages key variables such as age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), number of children, smoking status, and residential region to predict medical insurance charges.

# Dataset Overview:
The dataset consists of 1338 records of individuals with detailed health and demographic information. It includes:
age: Age of the individual (int)
sex: Gender of the individual (male/female)
bmi: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight (float)
children: Number of children covered under insurance (int)
smoker: Smoking status (yes/no)
region: Residential region in the US (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest)
charges: Medical insurance cost billed to the individual (float) â€“ target variable

# Purpose & Applications:
Predictive Modeling: Accurately estimate healthcare costs for individuals based on personal and lifestyle factors.
Insurance Analysis: Assist insurance companies in pricing policies based on risk factors.
Health Economics Research: Understand the impact of variables like BMI, smoking, and age on medical costs.
Education & Tutorials: Serve as a practical example for regression modeling, feature engineering, and machine learning workflows.

# Potential Insights:
The model can uncover patterns such as the correlation between smoking and higher medical charges, or the effect of BMI and age on insurance costs. This can help individuals plan healthcare budgets and enable insurers to design data-driven pricing strategies.

# Target Users:
Data scientists and students learning regression and predictive modeling
Health researchers analyzing cost factors in insurance

Insurance professionals exploring risk-based pricing

This project demonstrates how structured health data can be leveraged to predict individual medical costs and drive informed decisions in healthcare and insurance sectors.
